# wage
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis where different statistical methods were applied to determine the influence of several features on the target variable, Wage.
Key Steps in the Analysis:
Hypothesis Testing:

Normality tests were performed to assess whether the data followed a normal distribution. This step is essential to choose the correct correlation tests.

Pearson Correlation Test was used when normality was confirmed, as it measures the linear relationship between continuous variables.

Spearman's Correlation Test was applied when normality was not assumed, providing insights into the monotonic relationships between variables.

Correlation Coefficients:

The Correlation Coefficient quantifies the strength and direction of the relationship between variables. For example, Education and Experience were positively correlated with Wage, while Absenteeism was negatively correlated.

Scatter Plots:

Visual representations of the data were plotted using scatter plots to better understand the relationships and trends between the variables.

Libraries Used:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

matplotlib: For data visualization and plotting.

seaborn: For creating more advanced visualizations like heatmaps.

scipy: For statistical tests including the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality.

statsmodels: For regression analysis and hypothesis testing.

xgboost, sklearn: For machine learning model training and evaluation.

This project showcases how understanding data distributions and relationships between variables can inform critical business decisions and optimize strategies. By leveraging hypothesis testing and correlation analysis, businesses can make data-driven decisions that improve operations, marketing strategies, and financial performance.
